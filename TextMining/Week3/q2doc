“NEMTSOV is a national traitor! Execute the traitor!” wrote a commenter a few days ago, on an internet petition to strip Boris Nemtsov of his mandate as a deputy of the local council in the provincial town of Yaroslavl. On his Facebook page, Mr Nemtsov quipped right back (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?
fbid=766731653396437&set=a.289618704441070.64195.100001788291627&type=1&fref=nf&pnref=story) : “I just don’t understand one thing. Are they collecting signatures to strip me of my mandate, or to
execute me?”
The answer came just before midnight on February 27th, when Mr Nemtsov, a charismatic opposition politician who led the reform process while serving in Boris Yeltsin’s government in the 1990s, was assassinated on a bridge just steps away from the Kremlin. Mr Nemtsov was shot with four bullets fired from a passing car. The area is infested with video cameras, police, security services and secret agents charged with protecting Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Given the level of security in the vicinity of the Kremlin, it is hard to imagine why Mr Nemtsov's killers would have picked that spot for the shooting, unless they had reason to believe they would be able to escape. The assassins did not try to cover their traces; they did not shoot the woman who was walking with Mr Nemtsov. It is by far the most significant political assassination in recent Russian history. Many have drawn parallels between this crime and the fates of other recent victims, such as Galina Starovoitova, a democratic reformer killed in 1998. Yet the atmosphere in Russia is increasingly reminiscent of darker days from a more distant European past.

Boris Nemtsov: Liberal martyr | The Economist 2/28/15, 3:39 PM
￼It is an atmosphere Mr Nemtsov himself described 10 months ago (http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21601899-russian-presidents-unexpected-concessions- ukraine-reflect-fact-he-has-already-got) , when nationalist euphoria was building on the back of the annexation of Crimea and an escalating war in Ukraine. “I can’t remember such a level of general hatred as the one in Moscow today," Mr Nemtsov wrote on his Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/boris.nemtsov/posts/622917747777829?fref=nf&pnref=story) ...
Not in 1991, during the August coup, not even in 1993 [during Yeltsin’s stand off with parliament]. Aggression and cruelty are stoked by the television while the key definitions are coming from the slightly possessed Kremlin master. "National traitors", "fifth column", "fascist junta"—all these terms are coming from the same Kremlin office...The Kremlin is cultivating and rewarding the lowest instincts in people, provoking hatred and fighting. People are set off against each other. This hell can not end peacefully.
In the past year, the atmosphere of aggression and intolerance has only become stronger. A week ago, tens of thousands of well-dressed young men and women marched through the center of Moscow, carrying banners filled with hatred for liberals and vowing not to allow a Russian version of Kiev's Maidan revolution, or any return of the liberalism of the 1990s. Some carried Mr Nemtsov’s photograph, labeled “an organizer of Maidan”.
Mr Nemtsov was a figure who represented everything Mr Putin’s kleptocratic regime is allergic to. A charismatic and brainy physicist with curly black hair and smiling eyes, he stood by Mr Yeltsin when the Communists tried to stage a coup in August 1991. At the age of 32, he was appointed governor of Nizhny Novgorod. His market reforms and his open style of governance earned him the praise of Margaret Thatcher. Mr Yeltsin, who favoured Mr Nemtsov as his successor, persuaded him to join the government in Moscow in 1997. He was the first politician to label the new Russian tycoons as "oligarchs", seeing in them one of the main threats to Russian democracy. He challenged their influence, but soon lost his post as deputy prime minister.
Almost unique among Russian politicians, Mr Nemtsov remained scrupulously honest and sincere throughout his political career. He earned no riches, and at age 53 returned to grassroots politics, winning election as a deputy in the local council in Yaroslavl. Physically fit, he considered himself a marathon runner in politics. Mr Nemtsov could fairly claim to have spent his life guided by values rather than interests or ideology. His patriotism was unquestionable. At one point, he could have been Russia's president; instead he witnessed his country's descent into an ugly nationalism that ultimately cost him his life.
There are nevertheless many in Russia who consider Mr Nemtsov a "national traitor". They include the
private militia of Ramzan Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya, who has sworn to defend Mr Putin against attacks; members of the Kremlin’s own security services; the country's proliferating radical- nationalist biker and street gangs; Russian volunteers fighting in eastern Ukraine; and others. Mr Putin’s first reaction was that Mr Nemtsov’s killing was a "provocation", and his backers quickly insinuated that the country's liberals had killed Mr Nemtsov themselves to blacken the president's name. Within hours of Mr Nemtsov’s murder, Dmitry Olshansky, a Russian columnist, hinted that Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oligarch turned opposition activist, was to blame. With the cynicism and callousness typical of Mr Putin's era, he attacked liberals inclined to suspect that Mr Putin was responsible for the killing as "simple-minded sheep".
Who was responsible for Mr Nemtsov's murder is only one part of the question. The other is how his death will be used by the Kremlin. As Mikhail Iampolski, a Russian cutlural historian, wrote on his Facebook page, "one cannot exclude the possibility that the execution of Nemtsov could become for Russia something like the murder of Kirov". The reference was to Sergei Kirov, a charismatic Bolshevik leader who was assassinated in 1934 inside Leningrad's city hall. Stalin used Kirov's murder as an excuse to unleash a period of terror and purges.
Today's Russia does not have a machinery of ideology or repression on the scale of the 1930s. Mr Nemtsov did not present any plausible political threat. But the country does have plenty of the sort of scoundrels described in "The Devils", Dostoevsky's prophetic novel of moral degradation and political terrorism. “One or two generations of vice are essential now," explains that novel's chief provocateur, Petr Verkhovensky. "Monstrous, abject vice by which a man is transformed into a loathsome, cruel, egoistic reptile. That's what we need! And what's more, a little 'fresh blood' that we may get accustomed to it.”
